                <p class="bold"> Overview</p>
                <p>My friends and I got into playing the Table Top Game, Dungeons and Dragons a few years ago, and it
                    has been one of the main reasons that we have been able to stay in touch as people have begun to
                    move away
                    from home. As the distance between us spread, we had to move from meeting in person to playing on
                    Discord, and the resources are lacking. There are dice rolling bots out there, but they are very
                    specific with input, there are information bots out there, but they require paid accounts to use, I
                    decided to use my skills to my advantage and make what we had all been wanting. A simple, easy to
                    use, highly functional D&D Companion: MythicMate</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 10px;" class="bold"> Dice Rolling</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">When you are in the middle of a game, you don't want to have to remember
                    the complex syntax of commands, or worry about a misspelling ruining your flow, you want fast and
                    effective. For the dice rolling commands, MythicMate accepts any length of dice, and displays what
                    each one rolled for dramatic effect. It sorts through your input with regex, and if the bot for
                    some reason does not recognize a symbol, it will still roll your dice and alert you of the
                    error! No more pausing to ask "How do I roll again?"</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 10px;" class="bold"> Web Scraping</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">A lot of D&D content is locked behind a paywall, but there are user ran
                    sites like the DND5eWikiDot, that you can gather the important things from like rules, and spell
                    details. When I run the update command, it searches this wiki, and pulls the relevant information
                    from it, saving it as text files formatted in Discords markdown on my computer. When a user wants to
                    look up something, it references the
                    available text files, and offers autocomplete suggestions. The files are then simply passed into a
                    discord message with no further formatting needed, because it is all taken care of when scraping the
                    data. This results in lightning fast searches.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 10px;" class="bold"> AI Integration</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">While a lot of information about D&D is locked behind a paywall, even
                    more of it is scattered across random iterations of rule books, and source material. Utilizing
                    ChatGPT's interface, and precise preformatted instruction, I have created the "/ask" command. The
                    user simply types "/ask" and then their question, and my bot accesses the API and runs a formatted
                    request. The answer is then quickly returned in a message for them.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 10px;" class="bold"> Multithreaded Implementation</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">A Discord bot with AI integration is great until you realize the
                    processing delays involved with AI, specifically ChatGPT's API. When one user had a hanging request
                    for an AI generated rules check, no other user was capable of running commands. To solve this I
                    implemented multithreading, allowing each command to create and run on a new thread as soon as it is
                    called, keeping the main bot free to process incoming commands.</p>

                <p class="bold"> Overview</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">Featuring was an idea inspired by the immense number of genres that spotify's algorithms
                classify (there is over 5000) that we as Spotify listeners are unable to access. Spotify stores a lot
                of information about songs, such as the "danceability" of the song, or the "energy" of the song. To
                music lovers like myself, information like this is fascinating, and I wanted to provide other listeners
                with the statistics Spotify keeps hidden behind their API.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 10px;" class="bold"> Digestable Data</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">Telling you that your music has a danceability of 0.86, or that 1% of your music is
                considered Ectofolk (yes that is a real Spotify genre) does not do much on its own, the data needed to
                be easy to digest. To accomplish this, I heavily manipulated an open source Java addon called JFreeChart
                in order to achieve the visually appealing, and easy to understand graphs that Featuring presents to
                users.</p>

                <br/>

                <p class="bold"> Overview</p>
                <p>My lovely mother works for Travis County, and holds the title of Financial Auditor Analyst VI. One of
                    her monthly responsibilities is reconciling last month's account balance sheets against the current
                    months. She methodically searches through both 200 line Excel files, checking to make sure the
                    ending balances of last month matches the initial balances of this month. She then goes back through
                    the current month's file a second time, to check if any of the accounts have been listed twice.
                    <br/><br/>While visiting her while she was working from home, I noticed her keeping her face mere
                    inches from her computer screen. I asked her what she was doing, and she explained to me the
                    painstaking task of sorting through these two files. According to her, it takes her around 90
                    minutes to do this every month. I asked her, "Mom, why don't they have a program for something like
                    that?" She told me she didn't even know it was an option.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 10px" class="bold"> Constraints</p>
                <p>These two Excel spreadsheets are generated by their Odyssey database, so there a few things that are
                    uniform.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Column Titles</li>
                    <li>Row Labels</li>
                    <li>Order of Accounts</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px">I found however, that periodically before she received the files, someone
                    had poked around in them leaving an extra whitespace or shifting columns or rows around.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 10px;" class="bold"> The Solution</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">Step one was to teach myself Apache POI. I had done file manipulation
                    prior to this, but parsing through Excel files in Java without some outside help was too big of a
                    task. I fired up a Maven managed project and got to work pouring over documentation and tutorials.
                    Once I had a firm grasp on the various Objects and Methods the technology provided, I was ready to
                    move on.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Step two was navigating the files. This would have been easy if I thought I could trust that the
                    files were identical, but even one file that didn't fit the mold would cause issues on the user -
                    the exact thing this program is intended to prevent. I decided instead to play it safe, and navigate
                    through the file the way my mom does: Titles. The program searches through the document until it
                    finds column titles, and stores the index of any columns required for our algorithms. It then does
                    the same with the row labels, storing those containing information the algorithm needs.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Step three was the logic. The minute I heard duplicates, my mind went to unordered sets. I was
                    sitting down to implement this solution when I remembered an important constraint for the data. The
                    order of accounts was always going to be identical, meaning if there were duplicate accounts they
                    would be located on top of one another. A single for loop provided a bulletproof solution. The
                    solution I originally planned with an unordered set had a time complexity and space complexity of
                    O(n) where n is the number of accounts in the balance sheet. The iterative solution has the same
                    time complexity, has a space complexity of O(1) as it creates no new space. The checking of initial
                    versus ending balances works the same way, iterating through both files simultaneously, and
                    comparing their values.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Step four was the user interface. Console ran programs are fine for my personal use, but for the
                    average user, interface is important. I taught myself how to use Java Swing, to implement a
                    navigable UI, and of course to make it visually pleasing. The UI allows the user to select their
                    files, and generate a report. This report can be saved as a text file, for easy access in the
                    future.</p>

                <p class="bold"> Overview</p>
                <p>My girlfriend and I have been together for six years now, and last year when I really started getting
                    confident in my coding abilities, I decided to teach myself some Swift and make her an app. It's
                    cheesy, but doing things like this for people I love is one of my favorite ways of showing
                    affection.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 10px;" class="bold"> The App</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">I wanted the app to do a few things, remind us of important dates, remind
                    us that we care about one another, show us some of our favorite memories, and remind us of our plans
                    for the future. The logic is nothing too complex, the date reminder gets the local time and date
                    from the phone it's on, and compares it to the stored date (our anniversary). The other three
                    functions have their own array, of either text, images, or both. A random number generator pulls an
                    index from the available ranges, and displays the contents I put in that array.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In the future I would like to make this app customizable, and usable by anyone. I plan on adding a
                    new page to navigate to, where a user can upload their own images and memories, or change their
                    important date.</p>
